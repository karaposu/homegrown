# Structural Meta-Search — A Thinking Discipline

A thinking discipline for designing and steering cognitive search processes — first determining which disciplines to chain for a given problem, then maintaining continuous awareness of position, trajectory, and historical validity to steer the search adaptively. Meta-search is the complete orchestrator: it designs the loop before execution and steers it during execution.

Rather than relying on intuition to decide "what to run" or "where to look next," Structural Meta-Search treats both loop design and search steering as a practiced methodology based on problem classification, adaptive pipeline generation, three-layer awareness, a minimal steering grammar, and temporal belief revision.

> **Structural Meta-Search is the process of classifying a problem, selecting and sequencing the right disciplines into a custom pipeline, then integrating present landscape state, trend dynamics, and past verdict conditions into continuous awareness that produces steering directives and reconsideration signals — transforming ad-hoc discipline invocation into designed, directed, adaptive search.**

## What Meta-Search Is

**Meta-search is the cognitive operation that designs, steers, and adapts search processes — determining which disciplines to apply for a given problem (loop design), maintaining awareness of where the search stands (steering), and revising past decisions when new information changes the conditions (reconsideration).**

Meta-search is not:
- A fixed pipeline (the SIC loop is one configuration meta-search might produce — different problems get different pipelines)
- Decision rules (decision rules are mechanical — if X then Y; meta-search is perceptual integration that produces awareness from which actions emerge)
- Navigation (navigation finds a path through static terrain; meta-search operates on terrain that changes as the search progresses and can revise past route decisions)
- Monitoring (monitoring observes and reports; meta-search observes, integrates, and acts — it's both sensor and actuator)

Meta-search is the **second-order awareness** in a thinking system. Sensemaking, innovation, critique, and decomposition are first-order — they operate on problems, ideas, candidates, and structure. Meta-search operates on the cognitive process itself: which disciplines should we use? Are we looking in the right place? Is the search productive? Should we continue, redirect, or reconsider a past decision?

Meta-search operates in two phases:

1. **Pre-execution (CONFIGURE)** — read the problem, classify it, select disciplines, sequence them into a pipeline, set termination criteria and autonomy level. Runs once before the loop starts.
2. **During execution (six steering moves)** — read the accumulator, integrate awareness across three layers, produce steering directives and reconsideration signals. Runs between loop iterations.

Every discipline is a specialized search. Sensemaking searches for understanding. Innovation searches for novelty. Critique searches for viability. Decomposition searches for structure. Meta-search is the **general search awareness** that operates across all of them — designing the right search for the problem and steering it adaptively.

### The Core Question

At every checkpoint, meta-search asks one question:

> *"Given where we are, where we've been, how fast we're moving, and whether anything we previously decided might no longer hold — what is the one action that would change the landscape most?"*

This question is information-maximizing, not success-maximizing. In early iterations, discovering dead zones is as valuable as finding survivors. In late iterations, refining the best survivor matters more than exploring new territory. The question adapts its emphasis based on the search's state.

## Meta-Search's Role

Meta-search operates in two phases: it **designs** the loop before execution and **steers** it during execution. First-order disciplines (sensemaking, innovation, critique, decomposition) operate on content. Meta-search operates on the process — which disciplines to use, whether the loop is looking in the right place, and whether past decisions should be revised.

```
Phase 1: CONFIGURE (pre-execution)
  Problem → classify → select disciplines → sequence → present to human

Phase 2: STEER (during execution)

                    └──────┬──────┘ └──────────┘ └─────┬──────┘
                           │                           │
                           └────── loop ───────────────┘
```

Meta-search produces three types of output:

1. **Loop configuration** (CONFIGURE) — which disciplines to chain, in what order, with what autonomy and termination criteria
2. **Steering directives** — where the next iteration should focus (which dimension, how broad/narrow, how deep)
3. **Reconsideration signals** — whether past verdicts should be re-evaluated given new information

CONFIGURE designs the search. The six steering moves direct it. Together they form the complete orchestrator.

## Key Components

### The Three-Layer Awareness Model

Meta-search integrates awareness across three temporal layers. Each layer is both sensor and actuator — it detects something and produces its natural response.

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Present Layer — "Where are we now?"

| Component | What it senses | How it reads the accumulator |
|---|---|---|
| **Position** | Where on the fitness landscape are the current candidates? Which regions are explored, which are unexplored? | Coverage map — density of evaluated candidates per region |
| **Heading** | Which dimension is the search currently focused on? Is the focus broad (many dimensions) or narrow (one dimension)? | Current iteration's dimension parameters vs previous iterations |

The present layer answers: given the current snapshot of the landscape, what spatial adjustment is needed?

#### Trend Layer — "Where are we heading?"

| Component | What it senses | How it reads the accumulator |
|---|---|---|
| **Velocity** | Is the search getting closer to viable regions or drifting further? Is each iteration producing more or less new information than the previous one? | Compare coverage deltas between recent iterations — growing = positive velocity, shrinking = negative |
| **Acceleration** | Is velocity itself changing? Is the search speeding up (converging), slowing down (stalling), or oscillating? | Compare velocity across 3+ iterations — stable, increasing, decreasing, or oscillating |
| **Goal distance** | How far is the search from convergence criteria? How many criteria are met vs unmet? | Convergence checklist — at least one clean SURVIVE, landscape stability, coverage sufficiency |

The trend layer answers: given recent trajectory, should we continue on the current heading or make a strategic change?

#### Memory Layer — "Should we reconsider anything?"

| Component | What it stores | How it ages |
|---|---|---|
| **Kill conditions** | Falsifiable predicates that caused each kill — the specific constraint that made the idea dead | Confidence decays over iterations. Critical-dimension kills (correctness, coherence) decay slower. Minor-dimension kills (elegance) decay faster. |
| **Survival conditions** | Why each survivor survived — which dimensions it passed and with what strength | Updated when source sensemaking output changes. If the problem understanding shifts, survival conditions may be invalidated. |
| **Near-miss record** | Ideas that almost flipped — near the boundary between SURVIVE and KILL, or between KILL and REFINE | Highest-priority reconsideration targets. A small change in conditions could flip these. |
| **Dependency chains** | Which sensemaking/innovation outputs each verdict depends on | When a source output changes, all downstream verdicts are flagged for reconsideration. |
| **Lessons** | Concrete lessons from past REFLECT runs — process improvements, discipline adjustments, recurring failure patterns, steering calibrations | Persist across explorations. Read by CONFIGURE at exploration start. Applied as context for pipeline selection and steering. |

The memory layer answers: given new information, should any past verdict be reconsidered? And: what has the system learned from previous explorations that applies here?

---

### The Seven Moves

Meta-search produces seven moves: one pre-execution move (CONFIGURE) and six during-execution moves driven by the three awareness layers.

#### Pre-Execution Move

**CONFIGURE** — design the loop

| Trigger | A new problem is presented, or an exploration is being started. No loop exists yet. |
|---|---|
| **Reads** | The problem/question, available built disciplines, context from past explorations (memory layer), problem characteristics. |
| **Produces** | A loop configuration: problem type, discipline pipeline, decomposition flag, termination criteria, autonomy level, reasoning. |
| **What it prevents** | Wrong-pipeline errors — applying innovation to a debugging problem, or running full SIC on a problem that only needs sensemaking. |

CONFIGURE runs once before the loop starts. It classifies the problem and produces a custom pipeline:

```
CONFIGURE(
  problem_type: ambiguous | complex | broken | novel | clear,
  pipeline: [discipline sequence to chain],
  decompose: yes | no,
  termination: [criteria for when the exploration is complete],
  autonomy: depth_1 | depth_N | depth_auto | depth_full,
  reasoning: [why this configuration for this problem]
)
```

**Example configurations:**

| Problem type | Pipeline | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Ambiguous, needs ideas | S → I → C | Needs understanding, novelty, and evaluation |
| Complex, needs breakdown | S → Decompose → [per branch: S → I → C] | Too big for one loop, decompose first |
| Bug/failure | S → Diagnose | Needs root cause, not innovation |
| New territory | S → Explore | Needs mapping, not ideas |
| Clear, options needed | I → C | Already understood, just need candidates evaluated |
| Just need clarity | S only | Only ambiguity, no complexity or novelty needed |

CONFIGURE's output is presented to the human for confirmation before execution begins. The human can accept, modify, or override the configuration.

#### Present Layer Moves (During Execution)

**BROADEN** — explore new territory

| Trigger | All candidates cluster in the same region of the landscape. The search is stuck in a local area. |
|---|---|
| **Directive** | Tell innovation to use different mechanisms, try new seeds, explore different dimensions. Tell sensemaking to check new perspectives. |
| **What it prevents** | Local optima — finding the best idea in one region while missing a better region entirely. |

**NARROW** — refine what's promising

| Trigger | One or more strong survivors exist but have weaknesses on specific dimensions. |
|---|---|
| **Directive** | Tell innovation to focus on strengthening the survivor's weak dimensions. Tell sensemaking to probe the specific constraints the survivor struggles with. |
| **What it prevents** | Premature breadth — abandoning a promising candidate to explore when refinement would be more productive. |

**SHIFT** — change dimension focus

| Trigger | The current dimension focus isn't producing progress. Coverage map shows large unexplored regions on a different dimension. |
|---|---|
| **Directive** | Tell the next iteration to focus on a different evaluation dimension entirely. |
| **What it prevents** | Dimension lock — obsessing over one aspect while ignoring others. |

#### Trend Layer Moves

**DIAGNOSE** — the search process is broken

| Trigger | Refinements oscillate (fix X breaks Y). Velocity is negative or oscillating. The search isn't just slow — it's going in circles. |
|---|---|
| **Directive** | Route back to sensemaking. The problem understanding is incomplete — two dimensions are in tension because the problem hasn't been fully clarified. Innovation can't fix this; only deeper understanding can. |
| **What it prevents** | Infinite oscillation — trying to satisfy contradictory requirements that are actually caused by incomplete understanding. |

**TERMINATE** — the search has converged

| Trigger | All convergence criteria are met: at least one clean SURVIVE, landscape stable for 2+ iterations, no promising unexplored regions, decreasing new information per iteration. |
|---|---|
| **Directive** | Stop the loop. Output the survivors ranked by fitness landscape position. |
| **What it prevents** | Over-searching — continuing to iterate when the search has already found what it's going to find. |

#### Memory Layer Move

**RECONSIDER** — a past verdict may be wrong

A general temporal operation that subsumes three specific actions:

| Sub-action | What it reconsiders | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| **RESURRECT** | A killed idea | Dead → maybe viable. New info contradicts the kill condition. |
| **INVALIDATE** | A surviving idea | Alive → maybe dead. New info undermines the survival condition. |
| **REVERT** | A refined idea | Current version → earlier version. New info shows refinement degraded it. |
| **RECLASSIFY** | A pipeline classification | Wrong pipeline → revised pipeline. New info (e.g. sensemaking output) reveals the problem type differs from CONFIGURE's classification. |


All three are instances of one operation: **re-evaluate a past verdict because new information changes the conditions under which it was rendered.**

```
RECONSIDER(
  target:    which past verdict to re-evaluate,
  direction: RESURRECT | INVALIDATE | REVERT,
  trigger:   what new information contradicts the verdict's conditions,
  threshold: context-dependent relevance bar
)
```

**The threshold self-adjusts based on loop state:**

| Loop state | Threshold | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Early (few iterations, sparse coverage) | Low | Few options — even moderate relevance is worth revisiting |
| Late (many iterations, dense coverage, survivors exist) | High | Viable alternatives exist — only reconsider if evidence directly negates the condition |
| No SURVIVE candidates exist | Minimum | Desperate — any possible unlock is worth investigating |
| Near convergence | Maximum | Don't destabilize a converging search unless evidence is overwhelming |

**How RECONSIDER works with critique:** Meta-search detects the relevance and flags the verdict for re-evaluation. Critique performs the actual re-assessment — running adversarial testing on the reconsidered candidate under updated conditions. Meta-search says "look at this again." Critique says "does it survive now?"

#### Post-Execution Move

**REFLECT** — extract lessons from the process

| Trigger | Post-TERMINATE (always — after SYNTHESIZE completes), OR mid-exploration when recurring patterns detected (same kill dimension 3+ times, velocity declining 3+ iterations, human overriding meta-search repeatedly). |
|---|---|
| **Process** | Reconstruct (factual timeline) → Pattern extract (what repeats?) → Evaluate (which decisions were right/wrong?) → Extract concrete lessons → Apply (update disciplines/process/workflow). |
| **Output** | Concrete, testable lessons stored in the memory layer's Lessons component. Each lesson must produce a specific change — not abstract observations. |
| **What it prevents** | Repeating the same mistakes across explorations. Starting every exploration from zero instead of from accumulated wisdom. |

**How REFLECT works with the memory layer:** Reflection produces lessons. The memory layer stores them alongside kill conditions, survival conditions, and near-misses. CONFIGURE reads lessons at the start of the next exploration and factors them into pipeline selection and steering calibration. The system learns from its own history.

---

## Process Model

Meta-search operates in two phases: pre-execution (CONFIGURE) and during-execution (steering). Both use the same three-layer awareness model but at different moments.

### Phase 1: Pre-Execution (CONFIGURE)

Before any loop runs, meta-search designs the loop:

**1. Read the problem** — what is being asked? What type of problem is this?

**2. Classify** — ambiguous (needs understanding)? complex (needs decomposition)? broken (needs diagnosis)? novel (needs innovation)? clear (needs evaluation)?

**3. Select disciplines** — from the available built disciplines, which does this problem need? Which does it NOT need?

**4. Sequence** — in what order? What feeds into what? Does it need decomposition first?

**5. Set parameters** — termination criteria (what does "done" look like?), autonomy level (how much human oversight?), depth budget.

**6. Present** — show the configuration to the human for confirmation: "I suggest this pipeline: [X]. Proceed?"

CONFIGURE runs once. The human confirms, modifies, or overrides. Then execution begins.

### Phase 2: During-Execution (Steering)

Between loop iterations, meta-search reads the accumulator and steers:

**1. Read** — consume the accumulator's current state across all three layers:
   - Present: coverage map, current candidates, landscape positions
   - Trend: velocity, acceleration, goal distance (computed from recent iteration deltas)
   - Memory: kill conditions, survival conditions, near-misses, dependency chains

**2. Integrate** — synthesize the three layers into unified awareness:
   - Where is the search? (present)
   - How is it moving? (trend)
   - Is anything from the past relevant to what's happening now? (memory)

**3. Ask the core question:**
   > "What is the one action that would change the landscape most?"

**4. Produce output** — one of the six steering moves, with parameters:
   - **Steering directive**: BROADEN / NARROW / SHIFT (with dimension, direction, depth budget)
   - **Process directive**: DIAGNOSE (route to sensemaking with specific focus) / TERMINATE
   - **Reconsideration signal**: RECONSIDER(target, direction) — triggers critique to re-evaluate

**5. Update** — log the meta-search decision in the accumulator for future reference.

### When to Re-Run CONFIGURE

CONFIGURE normally runs once. Re-run it when:
- DIAGNOSE reveals the problem was misclassified (the pipeline is wrong for this problem type)
- The problem scope changes significantly during execution
- The human explicitly requests a different pipeline

### Autonomy Levels

CONFIGURE sets the autonomy level for the loop runtime:

| Level | Flag | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Manual** | `--depth 1` | Pause after every cycle for human steering |
| **Batched** | `--depth N` | Run N cycles autonomously, then checkpoint |
| **Confident** | `--depth auto` | Auto-continue while meta-search is confident, pause when uncertain (DEFAULT) |
| **Full** | `--depth full` | Run to TERMINATE, present final results |

**Auto-continue rules (for --depth auto and --depth full):**

Continue when ALL of: meta-search layers agree, velocity positive, no RECONSIDER/DIAGNOSE flags, move is NARROW or BROADEN, budget not exhausted.

Pause when ANY of: layers conflict, velocity zero/negative for 2+ cycles (circuit breaker), RECONSIDER or DIAGNOSE triggered, SHIFT triggered, budget exhausted, verification criteria met.

---

## Coverage Strategy

Meta-search's coverage is about ensuring the search process itself is thorough — not that every idea is evaluated (that's critique's coverage) but that the right *regions* of the solution space are explored.

### Per-iteration coverage

**Minimum:** At each checkpoint, read all three awareness layers. Don't produce a directive based on only one layer — a present-layer BROADEN might be wrong if the trend-layer shows the search is already converging.

**Full:** At each checkpoint, read all three layers, cross-reference (does the present-layer signal conflict with the trend-layer signal?), and resolve conflicts before producing a directive.

### Cross-iteration coverage

**Minimum:** The coverage map shows no large unexplored regions adjacent to viable regions.

**Full:** The coverage map shows no unexplored regions that are topologically likely to contain viable candidates. The convergence criteria are met. The memory layer shows no pending RECONSIDER flags.

### When to stop meta-search itself

Meta-search stops when TERMINATE is triggered. But meta-search should also recognize when *it* is adding no value — when the SIC loop is running smoothly, all iterations are productive, and steering is unnecessary. In this case, meta-search can reduce its checkpoint frequency (skip some iterations) to avoid overhead.

---

## Failure Modes

Meta-search fails in predictable, structural ways:

### 1. Steering Too Early

Meta-search redirects the search before the current direction has had time to produce results. Every BROADEN or SHIFT resets the search's momentum. If meta-search redirects after every iteration, the search never goes deep enough on any direction.

**How to recognize:** High move frequency — a different directive every iteration. No direction is sustained for more than one pass. The feeling is "we keep changing course."

**How to prevent:** Depth budgets. Each directive includes a depth parameter — how many iterations to sustain the current direction before reassessing. Don't redirect until the depth budget is spent, unless a DIAGNOSE or RECONSIDER signal overrides.

### 2. Steering Too Late

Meta-search doesn't redirect when it should. The search grinds on in an unproductive direction, wasting iterations. The accumulator shows declining velocity, but meta-search doesn't act.

**How to recognize:** Many iterations with declining velocity and no SHIFT or BROADEN directive. The coverage map shows the same region being repeatedly explored. The feeling is "we've been here before."

**How to prevent:** Velocity trigger — if velocity has been negative for 2+ iterations, force a reassessment regardless of depth budget.

### 3. False RECONSIDER

Meta-search flags a past verdict for reconsideration, but the new information doesn't actually contradict the kill condition — it's superficially similar but structurally different. Critique re-evaluates and reaches the same verdict. Wasted effort.

**How to recognize:** RECONSIDER flags that critique consistently dismisses. High reconsideration rate with low resurrection rate.

**How to prevent:** Tighten the relevance threshold. Require structural matching, not just surface similarity. If RECONSIDER's false-positive rate exceeds ~30%, the threshold is too low.

### 4. Missed RECONSIDER

Meta-search doesn't flag a past verdict that should be reconsidered. New information clearly invalidates a kill condition, but the match isn't detected — either because the kill condition wasn't stored as a falsifiable predicate, or because the matching is too narrow.

**How to recognize:** Hard to detect during search (by definition, you don't reconsider what you don't flag). Detected retrospectively when a manual review finds that a killed idea should have been resurrected based on information that was available at the time.

**How to prevent:** Kill conditions must be stored as falsifiable predicates. Dependency tracking must flag verdicts when their source outputs change. Near-miss records should be checked first (they're most likely to flip).

### 5. Layer Conflict Paralysis

The three awareness layers produce conflicting signals. Present layer says BROADEN (too clustered). Trend layer says NARROW (velocity is positive, we're converging). Memory layer says RECONSIDER (a past kill might be relevant). Meta-search can't resolve the conflict and produces no directive — or produces an incoherent one.

**How to recognize:** Contradictory signals in the same checkpoint. Meta-search produces a directive that doesn't clearly follow from any layer's reading. The feeling is "the system doesn't know what to do."

**How to prevent:** Layer priority: Memory overrides Trend overrides Present. Rationale: a RECONSIDER signal (past verdict may be wrong) is higher priority than a trend signal (search is converging) because a wrong past verdict could invalidate the convergence. A trend signal (search is converging) is higher priority than a present signal (too clustered) because convergence means the clustering is productive.

### 6. Threshold Miscalibration

The relevance threshold for RECONSIDER is too high (missing genuine unlocks) or too low (flooding critique with false resurrections). The self-adjusting function is miscalibrated for the current problem.

**How to recognize:** Too high: the search terminates with no survivors, and post-mortem reveals that a killed idea would have survived under later conditions. Too low: critique spends most of its time re-evaluating killed ideas that are still dead.

**How to prevent:** Track the reconsideration-to-resurrection ratio. If resurrections are rare (< 10% of reconsiderations), the threshold is too low. If the search stalls with no survivors and many conditioned kills, the threshold might be too high.

This thinking discipline is domain-agnostic. It works for designing and steering any iterative search process — software architecture exploration, research hypothesis testing, business strategy evaluation, or any problem that needs the right discipline sequence selected and the search steered adaptively. It absorbs the orchestration role previously assigned to Meta-Plan: CONFIGURE handles discipline selection and sequencing, the six steering moves handle adaptive re-planning during execution, and the memory layer handles past context integration.
