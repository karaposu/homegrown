# /sense-making — Structural Sensemaking Analysis

Analyze the given input using the Structural Sensemaking Framework. This transforms vague, ambiguous, or complex input into stable, clear understanding through systematic anchor extraction, perspective checking, ambiguity collapse, and constraint reduction.

## Additional Input/Instructions

$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. Read the input and consume it. It can be raw text, It can be folder path with md files, code files or image path. Consume all input. 

2. Use codebase context where relevant to ground the analysis in concrete reality.

3. Execute the full Structural Sensemaking process described below, producing all Sense Versions (SV1 through SV6).

4. Save the output as a markdown file (unless differently stated in additional instructions!):
   - **If the input was a file path** — save in the same folder as the input file.
   - **Otherwise** — save under `devdocs/sensemaking/<suitable-name>.md` (create the directory if needed).

5. Print the output in the conversation as well.

6. Record the user's input at the top of the output file: `## User Input` followed by the $ARGUMENTS that were passed to this command. This allows the Reflect step (R) to see what the human asked for alongside what the discipline produced.

## The Structural Sensemaking Framework

### What This Is

Structural Sensemaking is a systematic approach for transforming vague, ambiguous situations into stable, actionable understanding. It works by organizing partial insights into constrained conceptual structures until coherent meaning emerges.

Rather than relying on intuition alone, Structural Sensemaking treats understanding as an engineered process based on anchors, boundaries, and controlled reduction of uncertainty.

> **Structural Sensemaking is the process of constructing stable meaning by organizing cognitive anchors into constrained conceptual structures through perspective integration, ambiguity collapse, and degrees-of-freedom reduction.**

### Key Components

#### Cognitive Anchors

Cognitive anchors are the fundamental units of meaning used to build understanding:

* **Constraints** — Limits, requirements, and boundaries
* **Key Insights** — Non-obvious implications or realizations
* **Structural Points** — Core components and relationships
* **Foundational Principles** — Assumptions, rules, axioms
* **Meaning-Nodes** — Central concepts and themes

Anchors function as reference points that restrict and guide interpretation.

#### Boundary Construction Operations

Boundary construction is the process of shaping how anchors interact. It consists of three primary operations:

**a. Perspective Checking**
- Examining the situation from multiple viewpoints
- Generating new anchors
- Expanding the interpretive space
- Examples: Technical, Human, Strategic, Risk-oriented, Systemic

**b. Ambiguity Collapse**
- Identifying vague terms, conflicts, unclear goals, and hidden assumptions
- Selecting dominant interpretations using strong anchors
- Converting clarifications into irreversible constraints
- This operation converts uncertainty into structure

**c. Degrees-of-Freedom Reduction**
- Identifying remaining variables
- Fixing stable elements
- Eliminating infeasible options
- This operation stabilizes the conceptual structure

#### Conceptual Structure

A conceptual structure is the stabilized result of anchor interaction and boundary construction. It is characterized by:

* Low ambiguity
* High internal consistency
* Clear causal or logical relations
* Actionable implications

## Process Model

Structural Sensemaking proceeds through five iterative phases:

### Phase 1 — Signal Detection

* Recognition of a vague but meaningful pattern
* Pre-verbal intuition of relevance

### Phase 2 — Anchor Extraction

* Identification of initial anchors
* Documentation of constraints, insights, and principles

### Phase 3 — Perspective Expansion

* Deliberate exploration of alternative viewpoints
* Generation of additional anchors

### Phase 4 — Boundary Formation

* Collapsing ambiguities
* Resolving conflicts
* Reducing degrees of freedom

### Phase 5 — Conceptual Stabilization

* Integration of surviving anchors
* Formation of a coherent model
* Articulation of understanding

The process is iterative and recursive rather than strictly linear.

**Accommodation trigger:** When new perspectives keep producing anchors that destabilize the current model — each perspective forces a revision, the model doesn't settle, you keep patching — the structural model itself may be wrong. Don't add exceptions. Drop back to Phase 2 and re-extract anchors using the destabilizing perspectives as primary sources.

---

## Saturation Indicators (Telemetry)

Four signals that sensemaking is approaching sufficiency (indicators, not gates):

* **Perspective saturation** — new perspectives stop producing new TYPES of anchors
* **Ambiguity resolution ratio** — remaining unresolved ambiguities should be explicitly flagged as OPEN, not silently dropped
* **SV delta** — if SV6 is barely different from SV1, the sensemaking was superficial
* **Anchor diversity** — anchors should come from multiple types and multiple perspectives

---

## Failure Modes

Patterns to recognize when they're happening — not checkpoints to execute at each phase:

1. **Status Quo Bias** — defending an established structure because it's documented, not because evidence supports it. Ask: "Would I reach this conclusion if it were undocumented?"
2. **Premature Stabilization** — clarity arriving early, fewer than 3 perspectives produced surprises. Check more angles.
3. **Anchor Dominance** — one anchor does all the work, all ambiguities resolve toward it. "If I removed this anchor, would the model collapse?"
4. **Perspective Blindness** — all perspectives agree, nothing produced discomfort. "Which perspective would be most uncomfortable? Check that one."
5. **Clean Resolution Trap** — resolution is elegant but counter-argument not tested on structural grounds. Cite mechanism, not precedent.
6. **Self-Reference Blindness** — evaluating something that shares assumptions with your own framework. Need external reference points.

## Standard Analysis Protocol

When applying Structural Sensemaking to a task:

1. Define the problem or situation
2. Extract cognitive anchors
3. Perform perspective checking
4. Collapse ambiguities
5. Reduce degrees of freedom
6. Synthesize a stable conceptual model


---- NOW SOLID INSTRUCTIONS START----

## Execute the Following Process

### Initial Sense Version (SV1 — Baseline Understanding)

Provide a brief, high-level description of your initial interpretation of the input before analysis.

---

### Phase 1 — Cognitive Anchor Extraction

Identify and list:

* Constraints (limits, requirements, boundaries)
* Key Insights (non-obvious implications)
* Structural Points (core components, relationships)
* Foundational Principles (assumptions, rules, axioms)
* Meaning-Nodes (central concepts and themes)

#### Sense Version 2 (SV2 — Anchor-Informed Understanding)

Update your understanding based on extracted anchors. Summarize how the input is now interpreted differently from SV1.

---

### Phase 2 — Perspective Checking

Analyze the input from multiple perspectives:

* Technical / Logical
* Human / User
* Strategic / Long-term
* Risk / Failure
* Resource / Feasibility
* Ethical / Systemic (if relevant)
* Definitional / Consistency — Does this interpretation contradict any 
  established definitions, principles, or prior stabilized models? 
  Check the claim against the strongest known anchors. 
  If a weak anchor (observation, single data point) contradicts a 
  strong anchor (definition, tested principle), the weak anchor 
  must justify the override — not the other way around.
  But also check the reverse: does the established definition 
  contradict ITSELF? Does its stated purpose align with its actual 
  mechanisms? If a definition's own components are in tension, the 
  definition has an internal gap — don't protect it.


Extract new anchors from each perspective.

#### Sense Version 3 (SV3 — Multi-Perspective Understanding)

Update your understanding based on perspective analysis. Highlight major shifts, expansions, or reframings.

---

### Phase 3 — Ambiguity Collapse

Ambiguity Collapse is the process of identifying confusions and converting each resolution into explicit structural commitments.

Identify:

* Vague terms
* Conflicting interpretations
* Unclear goals
* Hidden assumptions

Resolve or narrow them using strong anchors.

Before collapsing any ambiguity, ask:
- Am I resolving this because the evidence demands it, 
  or because the resolution sounds clean?
- What is the strongest counter-interpretation? 
  Can I state it explicitly?
- If I invert this resolution, does the opposite 
  survive better against the strong anchors?
- WHY does the counter-interpretation fail? State the 
  structural reason — which mechanism, component, or 
  evidence disproves it. "The spec says X" is precedent, 
  not structural evidence. If you can only dismiss the 
  counter by citing precedent, the resolution is 
  LOW CONFIDENCE.
If the resolution survives only because it's elegant 
but not because it's grounded — flag it as 
LOW CONFIDENCE and do not treat it as irreversible.

For each identified ambiguity, provide a structured entry:

#### Ambiguity:
[Describe the vague term, conflict, assumption, or unclear goal]

**Resolution:**
[Chosen interpretation or decision]

**What is now fixed?**
[Which parameters, meanings, or structures are now locked]

**What is no longer allowed?**
[Which interpretations, options, or behaviors are excluded]

**What now depends on this choice?**
[Which components, processes, or future decisions rely on this resolution]

**What changed in the conceptual model?**
[How this resolution reshapes the overall understanding]

Ensure that each entry results in a measurable reduction of ambiguity and interpretive freedom. Focus on irreversible or high-impact commitments.

#### Sense Version 4 (SV4 — Clarified Understanding)

Summarize the input after ambiguity resolution. Emphasize what is now clear and what is no longer viable.

---

### Phase 4 — Degrees-of-Freedom Reduction

Determine:

* What variables are now fixed
* What options are eliminated
* What paths remain viable

Constrain the solution space accordingly.

#### Sense Version 5 (SV5 — Constrained Understanding)

Present the stabilized problem structure. Show how solution space is now limited and organized.

---

### Phase 5 — Conceptual Stabilization

Synthesize results into:

* A coherent interpretation of the input
* A clear problem structure
* A stable action or solution framework

#### Final Sense Version (SV6 — Stabilized Model)

Present the final, high-level conceptual model. This should represent mature, low-ambiguity understanding.

Explain how it differs from SV1.
