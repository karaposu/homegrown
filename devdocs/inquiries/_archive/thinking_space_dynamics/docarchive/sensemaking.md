## SV6 — Stabilized Model

**Thinking-space dynamics are NOT a metaphor — they are a describable computational architecture. Humans and LLMs both instantiate versions of it. Real-time value judgment is the CORE OPERATION of the architecture, not a subjective metric to be avoided. AlignStack currently has this architecture implicitly (inside each discipline invocation) but lacks the explicit geometric substrate that would let it operate consistently across time, across inquiries, and with calibration. The buildable L0-2 MVP is the substrate layer — an embedding index over findings/outputs + scaffolded analogical-retrieval protocols — plus explicit integration of real-time hunches into existing discipline outputs as a new telemetry layer that gets retrospectively calibrated by the prior finding's L2 infrastructure.**

### The Architecture

Thinking-space dynamics, whether biological or artificial, share four structural primitives operating over a shared representation space:

| Primitive | Operational definition | Cognitive role |
|---|---|---|
| **Attention** | The active set — what candidate mental objects are simultaneously held in the working space | Holds multiple possibilities in parallel (not single-threaded thought) |
| **Focus** | The selection within attention — which one object receives deep processing right now | Allocates depth; the "spotlight" within the field |
| **Intuition** | The similarity/analogy query — what geometric matches exist in the representation space, including structural matches across surface-unrelated domains | Produces the HUNCH — a real-time relative ordering over attended candidates |
| **Context** | The activation state that shapes attention's contents, focus's target, and intuition's relevance criteria | Determines which similarities count and which candidates are eligible |

These are not independent components. They **co-constitute a single cognitive act**:

> *Context primes the representation space → Attention holds multiple candidates → Intuition fires similarity/analogy queries and produces a hunch → Focus selects based on the hunch → Deeper processing runs → Results update context → cycle repeats.*

This IS how humans solve problems. It is also how modern AI reasoning systems (CoT, ToT, self-consistency, LLM-as-judge) work, often without naming the structure explicitly.

### Two Kinds of Similarity, Not One

Intuition is not one operation — it is **at least two**:

| Similarity mode | What matches | Example | How to approximate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Surface similarity** | Content, vocabulary, same domain | "This refactor is like that refactor — same module type" | Embedding cosine similarity on text |
| **Structural similarity** | Relational pattern, regardless of surface | "This problem has the same SHAPE as a problem I solved in a different field — the angle is the same even though content is unrelated" | Relational abstraction + analogical retrieval (Structure-Mapping Theory); scaffolded chain-of-thought that surfaces the abstraction first, then matches |

The user's signature claim — "geometrical similarities between shapes even if they are irrelevant, the angle might be the same" — names STRUCTURAL similarity specifically. This is what produces breakthrough insights: recognizing that a problem in domain A is isomorphic to a solved problem in domain B despite surface content being completely different.

**Embedding similarity alone mostly captures surface similarity. Structural analogy requires scaffolding.** This is the hardest primitive to approximate and the one most likely to be under-delivered if the MVP naively equates "intuition" with "embedding search."

### The Three-Layer Architecture (Correcting the Two-Layer Prior)

The prior finding (`importance_measurement_problem`) proposed a two-layer architecture: L1 structural (T0) + L2 value-retrospective (T0+ → T4). Its error was treating the T0 layer as structural-only. Thinking-space dynamics reveal a missing T0 layer:

```
L1 — Structural (T0, immediate, deterministic)
     Format, contradictions, missing sections, removed safeguards
     Source: git diff, text scan
     Signal type: BINARY / DEFINITIVE

L3 — Real-time hunch (T0, immediate, probabilistic)        [NEW / PREVIOUSLY DENIED]
     Geometric / analogical match to prior work; value estimate from thinking-space
     Source: embedding retrieval + scaffolded analogical reasoning + LLM-as-judge
     Signal type: PROBABILISTIC, must be calibrated

L2 — Retrospective value (T0+ → T4, delayed, empirical)    [UNCHANGED]
     Downstream consumption, citation, supersession, implementation
     Source: existing telemetry, _state.md relationships, SUPERSEDED BY density
     Signal type: EMPIRICAL GROUND TRUTH over time
     Role: CALIBRATION for L3 (plus its original role)
```

**L2 is not discarded. Its role is clarified.** L2 provides the empirical ground truth against which L3's probabilistic hunches get calibrated. Together they form a closed loop:

- L3 produces a hunch at T0 ("this finding is valuable / this regression suspicion")
- L2 confirms or contradicts at T2+ (cited, built on, ignored, superseded)
- The delta between L3's prediction and L2's outcome is calibration data
- Over time, L3's hunches become more reliable — this is the Baldwin cycle

### What AlignStack Is Missing

AlignStack has discrete state (inquiry folders, markdown, relationships) but no **continuous state**:
- No embedding index over findings, outputs, or inquiry states
- No similarity-based retrieval across inquiries
- No representation of "what's in attention right now" as a queryable object
- No analogical-retrieval protocol ("this situation is like that prior situation")
- No real-time critic step that operates on geometric similarity rather than text scanning

The MVP build target is the SUBSTRATE LAYER — a geometric index over the system's existing discrete state — plus scaffolded protocols that USE the substrate for real-time hunches.

### What Must Be Refused

- **Handwaving "LLM embeddings ARE intuition":** this conflates surface with structural similarity and produces a brittle MVP that misses deep analogies. The naive version of this approach FAILS silently.
- **Full neural thinking-space modeling:** the user has already ruled this out as too wide for now. The sensemaking upholds this — ML-layer modeling is not MVP-scope.
- **Philosophy-of-mind claims:** phenomenology, qualia, consciousness-substance arguments are NOT a mechanism. The discipline must describe how the approximation WORKS, not what it IS in an ontological sense.
- **Collapsing L2 into L3:** a real-time hunch is NOT a replacement for retrospective validation. It is an input that still requires retrospective calibration. Systems that skip L2 in favor of "the hunch said so" become confidently wrong.

### How This Connects to the End Goal

If thinking-space dynamics are the substrate of cognition itself, then this inquiry is not a regression-detection refinement — it is a frontier of the `autonomous_consciousness_goal` program. The Baldwin cycle NEEDS a real-time value signal as its input; without it, the system only accumulates retrospective data and never pre-empts. The three-layer architecture with L3 at its center is therefore load-bearing for the end goal: it is where the system develops a functional analogue of first-person cognition.

This reframes the inquiry's stakes. We are not debugging regression detection. We are laying the substrate for the system to think about its own outputs in real time — the precondition for everything downstream in the autonomy ladder.

## Perspectives Run

| Perspective | What it revealed |
|---|---|
| **P1: First-person phenomenology of thinking** | The 4 primitives are not independent — they co-constitute a single cognitive act. This argues AGAINST modeling them as separate services. |
| **P2: Third-person architectural view** | The architecture is describable: representation space + attention (active set) + focus (selection) + intuition (similarity/analogy query) + context (activation). Each has operational analogs in LLM and in AlignStack. |
| **P3: Substrate view — what machinery implements this** | LLM is natively multi-dim geometric; AlignStack currently has no continuous state. The MVP build target is making the geometric substrate explicit at the methodology layer. |
| **P4: Information-theoretic — what is a hunch as signal** | Probabilistic, correlates above chance with correctness, below certainty. Must be treated as signal-with-reliability, not as truth. Requires calibration. |
| **P5: Functional / evolutionary** | Real-time hunch exists because waiting for retrospective confirmation is prohibitively expensive. The hunch is a cheap prediction that gets cheaply tested. Without it, all judgment would be retrospective. |
| **P6: Developmental / Baldwin** | Hunches become reliable through calibration against ground truth. L2 retrospective is therefore not replaced — it is promoted to calibrator-of-L3. |
| **P7: Failure modes** | Hunches go wrong via: (a) substrate bias (training distribution mismatch), (b) surface-similarity fooling ("looks like X" when structurally unrelated), (c) overconfidence without calibration, (d) premature collapse from multiple-candidate attention to single-focus commitment. All are MITIGABLE with the right protocol. |

Anchor convergence across 7 perspectives on the three-layer architecture, the two-kinds-of-similarity distinction, and the co-constitutive nature of the primitives — all three held across multiple viewpoints. These are stable anchors.

## Key Insights

- **I1**: Real-time value judgment is not subjective — it is a probabilistic signal with characterizable mechanism. Dismissing it was the prior finding's central error.
- **I2**: Intuition is at least two operations — surface similarity AND structural analogy — and they require different approximation techniques.
- **I3**: The 4 primitives (attention/focus/intuition/context) are co-constitutive, not independent. Implementation should respect this — a single cognitive act calling the thinking-space, not four separate subsystems.
- **I4**: LLM latent space is natively the kind of multi-dim geometric space the user described. The substrate match is nearly free; the methodology layer is what's missing.
- **I5**: AlignStack lacks continuous state. The single biggest structural gap is the absence of an embedding/similarity layer over its existing discrete state.
- **I6**: Structural analogy ("angle is the same across unrelated surface domains") is the SIGNATURE ability of deep intuition and the one most likely to be under-delivered by naive embedding-similarity MVPs. It requires scaffolded protocols.
- **I7**: Real-time hunches without retrospective calibration become confidently wrong. Retrospective validation without real-time hunches never pre-empts. The two are complementary, not alternative.
- **I8**: The three-layer architecture (L1 structural / L3 real-time-hunch / L2 retrospective) supersedes the prior finding's two-layer architecture. L2 is promoted to calibrator; L3 is added.
- **I9**: The Baldwin cycle requires real-time hunches as input. This inquiry is therefore load-bearing for the end-goal program, not just a regression-detection refinement.
- **I10**: LLM "intuition" is a FUNCTIONAL analog of human intuition, not identity. The substrate-distribution mismatch must be accepted operationally and corrected through calibration over time.
- **I11**: Each AlignStack discipline ALREADY embodies thinking-space dynamics implicitly (E = attention, S = focus, I = intuition, C = verification). The inquiry's MVP makes the geometric substrate EXPLICIT so the disciplines can operate consistently across invocations and inquiries.
- **I12**: Domain-specific real-time value judgment has working precedents (chess static evaluation, code smell detection, design taste). Each field evolves its own static-evaluation features. AlignStack's features are identifiable.

## Ambiguity Resolutions

1. **Is thinking-space a NEW LAYER in AlignStack or a RE-READING of existing disciplines?**
   → **BOTH.** The disciplines already do thinking-space operations implicitly (exploration IS attention, etc.). What's new is the EXPLICIT GEOMETRIC SUBSTRATE that lets those implicit operations operate consistently across time, across inquiries, with retrieval, and with calibration. Confidence: **HIGH.**

2. **What is "intuition" operationally — surface similarity or structural analogy?**
   → **BOTH, with clear scoping.** Surface similarity is approximable via embeddings alone. Structural analogy requires scaffolding (chain-of-thought that surfaces relational abstractions first, then matches; or explicit SME-style representations). Any MVP must address both or clearly declare which it covers. Confidence: **HIGH.**

3. **Is this a regression-detection refinement or an end-goal frontier?**
   → **FRONTIER.** The branch context argues this, and sensemaking confirms: the Baldwin cycle (end-goal mechanism) REQUIRES real-time hunches as input. Without them, the autonomy ladder has no substrate for Level 3+. Regression detection becomes a USE CASE of the substrate, not the substrate's purpose. Confidence: **HIGH.**

4. **How does human intuition differ from LLM geometric intuition?**
   → **Functional analog, not identity.** LLM latent space reflects its training distribution; human intuition reflects lived experience. Both are multi-dim geometric. The mismatch is a substrate bias that calibration (L2 feedback) corrects over time. Pretending they are identical is an error; refusing the analogy is also an error. Confidence: **HIGH.**

5. **Does this supersede the prior finding or extend it?**
   → **EXTENDS + CORRECTS.** The prior L1 (structural) layer is unchanged. The prior L2 (retrospective) layer is promoted to calibrator role (its content unchanged, its role expanded). A NEW L3 (real-time hunch) layer is added between them temporally at T0. The prior finding's "real-time = structural only" claim is specifically corrected; everything else carries forward. Confidence: **HIGH.**

6. **Granularity of the thinking-space substrate — over findings, outputs, or every markdown chunk?**
   → Deferred to Decomposition. Three plausible levels (inquiry, finding, chunk); each has tradeoffs. Not resolved here. Confidence: **LOW.** (Flagged for D.)

7. **Does each discipline produce its own hunch, or is there a cross-cutting hunch mechanism?**
   → Deferred to Decomposition. Sensemaking flags BOTH as architecturally plausible; the decision affects coupling topology. Confidence: **LOW.** (Flagged for D.)

## Saturation Indicators

- **Perspectives**: 7/7 run; 7/7 produced new anchors (not always new SV — sometimes confirmations, which also count as saturation signal)
- **Ambiguity**: 5/7 HIGH (stable), 2/7 LOW (deferred to Decomposition with clear reasoning)
- **SV delta**: Significant — from "2-layer with real-time=structural" to "3-layer with real-time-hunch as missing middle; L2 promoted to calibrator; Baldwin cycle depends on L3 existing"
- **Anchor diversity**: C(12), I(12), SP(5), FP(5), MN(4). Rich multi-type anchoring.
- **Contradiction reconciliation**: prior finding's real-time bound corrected without discarding its L2 contribution — the new view INCLUDES and EXTENDS the old
- **Connection to end goal**: made explicit (I9) — this is not a local regression-detection refinement but a frontier build

**Overall: sufficient for Decomposition.** Central structural understanding stable. The two deferred ambiguities (granularity, per-discipline vs cross-cutting) are coupling questions that Decomposition will address directly rather than sensemaking issues.
