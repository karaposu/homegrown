# **Homegrown: A Swarm-Native LLM Operating System**

Homegrown is designed to allow swarms of agentic processes to be as flexible, self-governing, and self-organizing as possible—without locking them into rigid schemas. We believe this is the key to unlocking emergent behaviors.



## Main Features

* **Each  member (Core) of the swarm runs an Agentic Loop**  
  - **intent → plan → act → interpret → reflect → ↺** 

  - This enables each Core to independently understand, execute, and refine its role in a dynamic system.

* **Cores can natively spawn other Cores**  
  - Each Core has the ability to spawn new sub-Cores to deliberate on a specific task and run their own agentic loop in iterations. 
  
  - This mimics how humans handle unfamiliar problems. Imagine a developer receives a task they don't understand. How would they act?

    ```
    He would allocate dedicated time to research and run small experiments to validate his understanding. Once confident, they return to the original task and continue working—now informed.
    ```

  - This recursive delegation and learning process is native to Homegrown.

  


* **All information is stored in Sitozol**  
  - Sitozol is the shared memory substrate that all Cores can access.  
  It allows persistent state, shared knowledge, and coordination without tight coupling.

   - Sitozol also holds tools and multilayer context retrivial logic. 



* **Hierarchical organization and adaptive reshaping**  
   - Cores can ask their parents—or the user—for clarification or details.  
   Feedback flows both ways, and the swarm adapts based on that feedback.

   - Unlike static pipelines, Homegrown supports **feedback on feedback**—Cores can challenge or reshape their instructions if they conflict with system knowledge or contextual understanding. This avoids blind execution and encourages meaningful adaptation.


* **Workflow Myelination: Native way for optimisation**  

   - In neuroscience, myelination is the process by which neural pathways become insulated and vastly faster—repeated activity “hard-wires” a route so signals fire more efficiently. Similarly, once Homegrown has learned and validated a cascade of agentic loops, “myelinating” that workflow bundles it into a single, streamlined tool.

   

  - It “myelinates” that sequence—translating it into a compact, native function (or package) that carries the same logic but no longer needs per-step LLM prompts. This drastically reduces latency and cost for discovered tasks.   

  - If a myelinated task receives new type of data, The swarm can wake up and update the whole myelination. Or choose to process it separately as an exception. 



## 2. Goals

We’ve identified three representative challenges—each requiring a different problem-solving paradigm—to showcase Homegrown’s core strengths:



### 1. **Long-Form Document Generation**  
**Request:** “Produce a comprehensive 100-page analysis of the future of the world with AI.”  
**Why it matters:**
- Demonstrates the system’s ability to orchestrate its own outputs over multiple passes (respecting model token limits and document length constraints).
- Shows how Homegrown breaks a massive goal into smaller chunks, then stitches those parts into a coherent, structured whole.
- Validates that Cores can recognize their own limitations (e.g., context window) and spawn or collaborate to fill the gaps.



### 2. **Meta-Documentation Generation**  
**Request:** “Generate system documentation for a Python backend script that itself produces long text files based on an arbitrary topic.”  
**Why it matters:**
- Goes beyond generating content to testing whether Homegrown can introspect its own workflow.
- Verifies that Cores understand the architecture behind “generate long documents,” reviewing logs or thought-logs to architect a proper solution.
- Confirms the system doesn’t just produce prose—it understands the process that produces that prose.



### 3. **Multi-Tool Orchestration for Wild-Data Processing**  
**Request:** “Build a pipeline that uses asynchronous web scraping, data extraction and validation, plus database operations to ingest unstructured data from the web.”  
**Why it matters:**
- Validates Homegrown’s agility in combining multiple tools with precise coordination.
- Tests the system’s ability to handle “wild” or unnormalized data found via scraping, then normalize, validate, and persist it in a database.
- Shows that Homegrown can dynamically select, sequence, and monitor disparate tools to complete a complex, real-world workflow.
