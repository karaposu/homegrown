# **Homegrown: A Swarm-Native LLM Operating System**

Homegrown is **not** another prompt wrapper, agent framework, or workflow engine.
It’s a *self-organising ecosystem* where every unit of work—large or tiny—runs its own LLM-driven loop, collaborates with peers, and vanishes when the goal is met.
Think of it as **Kubernetes for reasoning**:

```
┌──────────────┐     spawn / escalate     ┌──────────────┐
│  Core A      │ ───────────────────────▶ │  Core B      │
│  (Designer)  │ ◀─────────────────────── │ (Researcher) │
└──────────────┘     ask / answer         └──────────────┘
       ▲                                   ▲
       │                                   │
       └────── governor schedules ─────────┘
```

## 🌟 What Makes Homegrown Unique?

| Trait                                    | Why It Matters                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LLM-native at every layer**            | Plans, actions, reflections, even *glue logic* are produced by the model—no brittle if/else trees.                                                                            |
| **Core = function + agent**              | Each Core owns a single objective, memory slice, and token budget. It can spawn children, call tools, or finish—nothing else.                                                 |
| **Instinct-driven**                      | Instead of rigid rules, global “instincts” (seek clarity, parallelise, economise) bias every Core. Tweaking one phrase in the system prompt changes the behaviour swarm-wide. |
| **Selective context gatherers (SCGs)**   | Cores declare interest tags; SCGs stream only relevant events into their vector memory. Context stays short, cost stays low.                                                  |
| **Tool registry as first-class citizen** | One decorator registers a tool, hot-swappable at runtime. Planner sees cost, confidence, side-effects, and decides.                                                           |
| **Governor as soft OS scheduler**        | Simple FIFO by default, or pluggable distributed queue. Enforces TTL, max cycles, side-effect quotas, and gathers metrics.                                                    |
| **Emergent recursion**                   | A Core can spawn Cores, which can spawn Cores… depth limited only by your policy. Complex projects decompose *organically*.                                                   |
| **Memory tiers**                         | Scratchpad (RAM) → Thought Log (vector DB) → Ledger (append-only Markdown). Short-term agility, long-term auditability.                                                       |

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### 1  Recursive Planning & Delegation

* A *Genesis Core* seeds the project goal.
* Planner identifies sub-domains → `spawn_new_core`.
* Each child Core receives a trimmed context, new instincts, and its own toolset.

### 2  Dynamic Tool Orchestration

* Tools advertise latency, cost, confidence.
* Planner chains them on-the-fly: *“scrape → validate → impute”* with no hard-coded paths.
* Missing dependency? The tool raises `ToolError`; Planner re-routes instantly.

### 3  Zero-Lock-In Extensibility

* Add a new tool—brightdata, Rust CLI, REST endpoint—with a 10-line wrapper.
* Add a new instinct—*“always cite sources”*—by editing one prompt block.
* Swap the Governor for Celery, Ray, k8s Jobs without touching Core code.

### 4  Cost & Latency Awareness

* Metrics decorator records every tool call.
* Governor throttles when budget crosses a threshold.
* Planner can drop from GPT-4o to a cheaper model mid-task if precision isn’t critical.

### 5  Autonomous Self-Improvement

* Reflection detects stagnation → spawns *Tutor Core* to learn missing concept.
* Successful multi-phase chains can be **compiled** into reusable Python functions—future Cores call them without tokens.

## ♾️ Why “Limitless”?

* **Any scale** — single-file script on a laptop or thousands of live Cores in a cluster.
* **Any domain** — generate code, write white-papers, ETL pipelines, marketing copy; just supply tools.
* **Any depth** — from a one-shot answer to a multi-week, multi-Core software build, the same primitives apply.
* **Any evolution** — change instincts, swap models, add memory back-ends; behaviour adapts instantly.

> **Homegrown isn’t a framework you *extend*.
> It’s an organism you *feed*.**

# Native 
Agentic workflows uses 2 steps

1. Agent loops: which handles core operation of taking an input and giving an output in micro level. 

2. Agentic Core Components:  peripherals for agentic workflows which enhances agentic workflow into a system level. and give them actual useful problem solving capabilities 


Agent loop consists of core internal flow :

intent  →  plan  →  act  →  interpret  → loop reflection - >  memory ↺

And Agentic Core Components are abstarct features such like:  
Multilayer Context
Reflection
Extensive Planning       
Tool Orchestration
Self-Modeling 
Dynamic Memory
Integrated Awareness
Holistic Memory
Autonomous Productive Capacity


there are different approaches to achive/reach these Core Components. And all frameworks treats LLM operations as not enough and support and fill between the operations with lots of python code. 

This has 2 harmful outcomes.  First is scalability problems. To scale your agent you should enhance both agent loop codes and your code resposible of creating abstarct features. Which is not maintainable on the long run. 

Second harmful outcome is about chaining and self calling and recursive looping.  Such manual code based scaffolding makes chaining and self calling non-native and tool calling like.  

So with Native what we do is like every organ in the body is composed of cells and cells are made from atoms, we maintain similar structure in the overall agent by composing each piece from LLMs.  
Agent loop components (intent,  plan ,  act ,  interpret , loop reflection ) are all composed of LLM calls. We dont use python scaffold around everything and this is amazing. 



our framework has 2 slogans

- minimal glue code, maximal LLM calls
- When GLue is absolutely needed, we also use an LLM for glueing
